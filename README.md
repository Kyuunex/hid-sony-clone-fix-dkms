# hid-sony-clone-fix-dkms
A patched Sony HID driver DKMS package to account for third party clone DS4 controllers that don't report MAC address correctly.

If you are having an issue where the USB controller disconnects this and other devices every few seconds, please use a USB hub and connect your DS4 clone to that.

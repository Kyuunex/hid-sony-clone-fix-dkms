# hid-sony-clone-fix-dkms
A patched Sony HID driver DKMS package to account for third party clone DS4 controllers 
that don't report MAC address correctly.

If you are having an issue where the USB controller disconnects this and other devices every few seconds, 
please use a USB hub and connect your DS4 clone to that.

Also, I take no responsibility should anything happen to your PC or anything you connect to it, 
should you use this patch/package/module/whatever. 
You are the one who chooses to keep using that knock-off controller, so it's on you. 
I recommend getting an original DS4 and using it without this patch/package/module/whatever.
